# PAC-Squirrel

Description
It is a game, that comes with a build-in checting function. 
Players will use 'w', 's', 'a', 'd' to control a Squirrel to move in a maze. 
When the squirrel eats every nut in the maze, the game will end. 
The fun part is that the game will ask players whether they want to cheat. 
If players said yes, the script will find the shortest path to each nut. 
The goal of script is "use as few moves as possible to finish the game".

Developer's Words
I wrote this game and the script all by myself. It has 9 classes, about 1000-line code and combines Greedy Algorithm, Breath-First Search and other algorithms to solve the problems. Finding the shortest path in a maze belongs to graph theory. Graphic search is one of the hardest problems in computer science. Therefore, I am really glad I did it.
